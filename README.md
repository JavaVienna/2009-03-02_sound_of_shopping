This art project, presented by **Christoph Pickl**, deals with generating music by given barcodes. The customer should actually be able to listen to an individual piece of music which dependes on the products bought and the current date. The song can afterwards  be transformed back -theoretical- to the original barcodes and date.

SoS deals with commerce and consumption criticism. It is not about marketing, because the customer even won't get anything he wants. at the time of generating the music, it is not defined what the output will be like and therefore could not match the customer's musical taste.
